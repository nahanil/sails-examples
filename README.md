# SailsJS Examples

A [Sails v1](https://sailsjs.com) example project to show how different things are done with and around the SailsJS framework.

Start application with `sails lift`, browse to [`http://localhost:1337`](http://localhost:1337) and view current tasks, the backlog and what is already available.

Best, Mark

### Version info

This app was originally generated on Wed May 27 2020 08:45:45 GMT+0200 (Central European Summer Time) using Sails v1.2.4.

<!-- Internally, Sails used [`sails-generate@1.17.2`](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-generate/tree/v1.17.2/lib/core-generators/new). -->


This project's boilerplate is based on an expanded seed app provided by the [Sails core team](https://sailsjs.com/about) to make it easier for you to build on top of ready-made features like authentication, enrollment, email verification, and billing.  For more information, [drop us a line](https://sailsjs.com/support).


<!--
Note:  Generators are usually run using the globally-installed `sails` CLI (command-line interface).  This CLI version is _environment-specific_ rather than app-specific, thus over time, as a project's dependencies are upgraded or the project is worked on by different developers on different computers using different versions of Node.js, the Sails dependency in its package.json file may differ from the globally-installed Sails CLI release it was originally generated with.  (Be sure to always check out the relevant [upgrading guides](https://sailsjs.com/upgrading) before upgrading the version of Sails used by your app.  If you're stuck, [get help here](https://sailsjs.com/support).)
